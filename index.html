                This is a website dedicated to my favorite, the tiger. I actually don't know if the tiger is my favorite animal, but I do have to make a fan page dedicated to an animal, and as far animals go, tigers are pretty rad. They come in all sorts of different colors. And by all sorts I mean mostly white and black and orange.

                Tigers are like cats, but bigger. Also a lot more deadly, which is an unfortunate side effect of there being effectively more cat to love. You win some and you lose some.
